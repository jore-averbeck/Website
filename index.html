        <article class="sub-article"> <p class="sub-article-text">During my scientific career, I was particularly interested in agile and innovative problem solving. In this context, I was not only able to demonstrate my analytical skills, but also perfected my ability to continuously familiarize myself with new topics. I wrote my Master's thesis in the field of inclusion and I am also committed to accessibility in my private life. As a project manager, I have also gained extensive experience in all areas of project organization. At the same time, I have been enjoying creating digital art/poetry under the pseudonym "noname_noa" for several years and have already published my first works here. Accordingly, I find topics related to UX/UI design exciting.

          Since my passion is coding and I was able to expand this competence in further education in web development, I would be very happy to start my IT career!🚀</p></article>
